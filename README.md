# DevinsMod

Welcome to **DevinsMod**, a collection of custom mods created by Devin. This repository serves as a hub for innovative and exciting modifications, with plans to expand and include even more modules in the future!

## Current Module

### **DevinsTrader**
The first module in this collection, **DevinsTrader**, is a fully-featured mod designed to enhance trading functionality. Explore its capabilities and enjoy the improved experience it provides.

## Contributors

This project wouldn't be possible without the amazing contributions of:

- **TylerTheDev**: Responsible for creating all the utility mixins and trackers that power the functionality of the mods.
- **EBS**: Made **DevinsMod** into its own standalone addon, helping bring everything together.

A huge thanks to both for their incredible work!

## Future Plans
This is just the beginning! The repository will continue to grow with additional modules being developed and added over time. Stay tuned for more exciting updates.
