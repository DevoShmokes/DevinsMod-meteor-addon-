DevinsMod

Welcome to DevinsMod, a collection of custom mods created by Devin. This repository serves as a hub for innovative and exciting modifications, with plans to expand and include even more modules in the future!

Current Modules

DevinsTrader

The first module in this collection, DevinsTrader, is a fully-featured mod designed to enhance trading functionality. Explore its capabilities and enjoy the improved experience it provides.

DevinsCrafter

A brand-new addition, DevinsCrafter automates your crafting workflow from start to finish. Key features include:

Selective Fetching: Pull only specified raw items from your farm chest.

Automated Crafting: Craft target items automatically at a crafting table with optional shift-click batching.

Selective Export: Move only designated finished items into your export chest.

Auto Mode: Seamlessly cycle through farm → craft → export → return steps when enabled.

Anti-Desync: Optional inventory sync on each craft to reduce server desync issues.

Custom Delays & Limits: Configure ticks between actions, action rate limits, and more.

Dive into the DevinsCrafter module to set up your farm chest, crafting table, and export chest positions, and let the automation handle the rest!

Contributors

This project wouldn't be possible without the amazing contributions of:

TylerTheDev: Responsible for creating all the utility mixins and trackers that power the functionality of the mods.

EBS: Made DevinsMod into its own standalone addon, helping bring everything together.

A huge thanks to both for their incredible work!

Future Plans

This is just the beginning! The repository will continue to grow with additional modules being developed and added over time. Stay tuned for more exciting updates.
